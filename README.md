my SublimeText configuration for using it instead of IDE.

Must have:
1) [Package control](https://packagecontrol.io/)
2) [Language servers & Syntax highlighting](https://github.com/kifio/code-editors-notes/blob/master/LSP.md)
3) Plugins and tools:
    - [Kotlin Syntax Highlights](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-spec)
    - [XML/JSON](https://github.com/kifio/sublimetext_indentxml)
    - [Terminus](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Terminus)
    - [GitGutter](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter)
    - TODO: snake-camel cases toggler
4) Key bindings:
    - TODO: Upload keymaps for osx and other os's.
    - TODO: Binding for search-replace
5) Android support. This is a huge and still not investigated topic for me. 
    - Logcat. It looks simple. Just write Pidcat (need link) output into the terminal.
    - Build configurations. Looks easy, Sublime has had good possibilities for it.
    - Launch emulator from sublime text.
    - Looking sources for Android SDK, JDK.
    - Support for features like Compose is questionable.
    - SVG to Vector drawable (hopes it's possible).

Definitely needed later:
- UI plugin for Android SDK manager.
- UI plugin for AVD manager.
- Support for Dart, Flutter SourceKit and iOS SDK.
